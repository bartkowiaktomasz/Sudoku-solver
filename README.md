# Sudoku-solver
Brute-force, backtracking (recursive) search sudoku solver in C++.
The solver was part of an assignment on the C++ course at ICL (see specification.pdf)

To solve sudoku, just replace a board.dat file with initial numbers, where empty cells are represented as dots. Example .dat file:

```
...1.83..
24..5....
..8....61
..4..9..3
.6.....2.
3..8..1..
17....9..
....1..52
..27.4...
```
Usage: compile with `make` and then type `./sudoku`.
